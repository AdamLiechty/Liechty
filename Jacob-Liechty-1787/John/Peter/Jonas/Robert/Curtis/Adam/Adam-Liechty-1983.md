## Early Life
Adam moved with parents to Houlton, Maine, for one year shortly after birth, before returning to the Fort Wayne area.
He and his parents lived in New Haven, IN, where his brother [Anthony (Tony)][tony] was
born, followed by an apartment in Leo, IN near Leo Jr./Sr. High School until he
was around four years old. They moved to a house in Grabill, IN where he lived
the remainder of his childhood. [Jacob][jacob] and [Hannah][hannah] were born while they lived at their
home in Grabill.

Adam and his family attended Calvary Temple church in Fort Wayne until he was in
first grade, when they began attending Grabill Missionary Church several blocks
away. Adam was homeschooled by his mother, [Joy][joy], for Kindergarten and first
grade. Having finished the first grade curriculum halfway through the year, and
wanting to attend a "regular" school, his parents enrolled him at Harlan
Elementary, a public school nearby.

Adam's father, [Curtis (Curt)][curt], coached Leo High School's boys cross country and long distance track and field teams,
and Adam frequently came along for practices and meets in his elementary school, years, attempting to keep up with the high school runners. One of Curt's rules
for his team was that if Adam beat any runner on any given quarter-mile lap
during a practice, that runner had to run an extra lap. Adam attended Harlan
Elementary through grade 6, but was able to begin running with the Leo Jr. High
School cross country team starting in 6th grade. He ran cross country in 6th-8th
grades, and track and field in 6th and 7th grades in the 800 and 1600 meters. He
played on a club soccer team in 8th grade, just making the cut.

### Jobs
Adam held early jobs as a paper boy in Grabill (Fort Wayne Newspapers), with Burger King, and construction and carpentry with his father's small general contracting company, Home Dynamics. He had internships the summers of 2001 (Innotek, maker of Invisible Fence for dogs) and 2002 (IT for Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.) In 2003 he had his first of two internships with Microsoft.

### Programming
Adam's parents bought the family's first computer when he was in 4th grade.
They bought him the book [QBASIC by Example](http://www.amazon.com/QBasic-By-Example-Special-Edition/dp/1565294394)
near the end of elementary school, which he used to teach himself basic computer
programming.
Mid-way through high school, Adam taught himself the basics of trigonometry as
he built his first major software project, a 3D graphing calculator, using
Visual Basic. He used this project to enter the Fort Wayne Science and Engineering Fair, advancing to the Indiana State Science and Engineering Fair. The 3D graphing calculator was also central to winning the Sterling Sentinel
Award in Mathematics in Fort Wayne in 2001.

## Personal Life
Adam moved to Seattle, WA in August 2005 to begin his career at Microsoft. His
brother, [Jacob][jacob], interned and began his career at [343 Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/343_Industries) in Microsoft,
working on [Halo 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3) and [Halo 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_4), and lived with Adam several times.

Adam met his wife, Lauren, in 2010, and they were married June 26, 2011 at Bridal
Veil Lakes. They moved to San Francisco in October 2012 where Adam started a job
with [DoubleDutch](https://doubledutch.me). Adam and Lauren volunteered with
[San Francisco City Impact](http://www.sfcityimpact.com/) visiting residents of
the Drake Hotel, a low-income housing building in the Tenderloin District. They
were members of [Reality SF](http://realitysf.com/) and hosted and led a small
group at their home in the Sunset District of San Francisco. They moved to the
Portland, Oregon area in 2014 when DoubleDutch opened an engineeering office
there.

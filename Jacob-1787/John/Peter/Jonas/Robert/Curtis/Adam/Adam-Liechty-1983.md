# Adam Christian Liechty
April 26, 1983 (Fort Wayne, IN) -

Moved with parents to Houlton, Maine, for one year shortly after birth, before returning to the Fort Wayne area.
He and his parents lived in New Haven, IN, where his brother [Anthony (Tony)](../Tony/Tony-Liechty-1984.md) was
born, followed by an apartment in Leo, IN near Leo Jr./Sr. High School until he
was around four years old. They moved to a house in Grabill, IN where he lived
the remainder of his childhood. [Jacob](../Jacob/Jacob-Liechty-1989.md) and [Hannah](../Hannah/Hannah-Liechty-1989.md) were born while they lived at their
home in Grabill.

Adam and his family attended Calvary Temple church in Fort Wayne until he was in
first grade, when they began attending Grabill Missionary Church several blocks
away. Adam was homeschooled by his mother, Joy, for Kindergarten and first
grade. Having finished the first grade curriculum halfway through the year, and
wanting to attend a "regular" school, his parents enrolled him at Harlan
Elementary, a public school nearby.

Adam's father, Curtis (Curt), coached Leo High School's boys cross country and long distance track and field teams,
and Adam frequently came along for practices and meets in his elementary school, years, attempting to keep up with the high school runners. One of Curt's rules
for his team was that if Adam beat any runner on any given quarter-mile lap
during a practice, that runner had to run an extra lap. Adam attended Harlan
Elementary through grade 6, but was able to begin running with the Leo Jr. High
School cross country team starting in 6th grade. He ran cross country in 6th-8th
grades, and track and field in 6th and 7th grades in the 800 and 1600 meters. He
played on a club soccer team in 8th grade, just making the cut.
